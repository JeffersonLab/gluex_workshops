DSelector_etapi.C/h provide an implementation of a DSelector for the reaction 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma p\rightarrow\pi^0\eta p \rightarrow 4\gamma p"> 

To run the DSelector, runDSelector.C is used. Inside this macro, the physics analysis trees can be run over by Adding
them to a TChain. Once in a chain, PROOF can be used to run the DSelector multi-threaded for quicker runtimes. PROOF 
will output a root file of the reduced tree and a root file of the histograms made during the process. Once you are satisfied
with the program inputs, you can simply run it by

root -l -b -q runDSelector.C

It is helpful to visualize the event selections to see what the effects are. DSelector_etapi makes various histograms
including most of the relevant variables that are used in the event selection process. It is also quite simple to draw
shaded boxes and functions to denote the selection regions. drawCuts.C is a macro that does this. It is another 
argument-less macro and can be run simply as

root -l -b -q drawCuts.C

To prepare for amplitude fits, the reduced tree that is output from the DSelector scripts has to be reorganized and
simplified abit. To do this, tree_to_amptools program have been developed. To run the program

tree_to_amptools input_file_name input_tree_name

where input_file_name is the root file that contains the reduced tree and input_tree_name is the name of the tree, i.e.

tree_to_amptools output_tree.root pi0eta__B4_M17_M7_Tree
