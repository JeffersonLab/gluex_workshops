This session was directed at Amplitude Analysis and likelihood fitting.  A few plots related
to GlueX reactions of interest were shown in order to give a feeling for the key kinematic
variables.  Here are some general instructions for reproducing those plots.

1) examine and edit the AmpTools config file:  gen_res.cfg

   This is a simplified config file that is intended to generate a single resonance in a single
   reflectivity amplitude, and a single m projection with full polarization.  The intent of this
   exercise is to understand how changing reflectivity, L, M, etc. cause changes in various
   kinematic variables.


2) generate 10,000 events using gen_amp and write to an FSRoot compatibile file:

   gen_amp -o res.root -fsroot -c gen_res.cfg


3) make a plot of various key kinematic variables:

   root -l plotAngles.C
