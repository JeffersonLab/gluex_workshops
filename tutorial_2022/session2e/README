This directory contains two example AmpTools fits.  These fits contain an 
amplitude set that is appropriate for roughly measuring the a2 cross section
in the eta pi0 channel.  The D wave amplitude set comes from the Tensor 
Meson Dominance model from JPAC that specifies which m projections of the 
D wave tend dominate natural and unnatural parity exchange.

The dynamics of the D wave are described by a Breit Wigner consistent with
the parametrization of the a2.  The S-wave is modeled by a coarsely-bind 
piecewise complex function.  This is likely not ideal for the small data set 
used in this tutorial but is sufficient to illustrate the idea.

0) cd to your own copy of the session2e directory from the GitHub repository

1) Begin by creating a symbolic link from a work disk directory that 
holds the data files to be fit:

ln -s /work/halld/gluex_workshop_data/tutorial_2022/session2e/fsroot .

2) Do a fit with one polarization state:

fit -c etapi0_SD_TMD_onePol.cfg

3) Build the command line tool to display information about the fit
and run it

make
./displayFitResults etapi0_SD_TMD_onePol.fit

4)  Use the plotter to visualize the results (needs X11 graphics):

plot_etapi0 etapi0_SD_TMD_onePol.fit

5)  Load the MPI module on the ifarm to try an MPI fit:

module use /apps/modulefiles
module load mpi/openmpi3-x86_64

6)  Run an MPI fit with 10 processes to fit all polarization states:

mpirun -np 10 fitMPI -c etapi0_SD_TMD_allPol.cfg

7)  Repeat steps 3 and 4 above with the file:  etapi0_SD_TMD_allPol.fit
