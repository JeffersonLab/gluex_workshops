# Session Title / Description

TODO: Need add how to load the container on the farm

## :dart: Goals
- Goal 1: Learn about Regularization in PWA
- Goal 2: Connect to Maximum likelihood, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Information Field Theory
- Goal 3: Learn about a streamlined framework to do this

## :clipboard: Prerequisites
- General understanding of PWA, ability to connect to the jlab farm
- analysis_chain.ipynb is a tutorial as of this writing, see **Analysis Tutorial** below for updated version
- Useful links:
  - [Analysis Tutorial](https://lan13005.github.io/PyAmpTools/demos/analysis_chain.html)
  - [Regularization Documentation](https://halldweb.jlab.org/doc-private/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=6826)

## :file_folder: Materials Provided
- Nothing, just connect to the container on the farm, everything is self contained as it is an input output test -> drawing simulations then fitting

## :memo: Session Outline
1. **Introduction**: Presentation on Regularization and the pyamptools framework
2. **Wrap-Up**: Run the tutorial
