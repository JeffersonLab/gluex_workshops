# Session Title / Description

## :dart: In this session we will learn the following:
- Read and recognize the data stored in the output ROOT file of the ReactionFilter plugin
- Learn how to use a DSelector to analyze data or accepted MonteCarlo
- A quick overview of the analysis process

## :clipboard: Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C++ and ROOT 
- Make sure you have sourced your GlueX enviroment!
- [Include links to resources]

## :file_folder: Materials Provided
- [List of files, scripts, or datasets provided for this session. Large datasets should be located in `/work/halld/gluex_workshop_data/tutorial_2025` and referenced]
- [Links to any additional resources or documentation]

## :memo: Session Outline
1. **Introduction**: DSelectors are a tool designed for Hall D data analysis that allows acess to all the information that is stored inside the output ROOT file of the ReactionFilter plugin. This session navigates some of the basics such as plotting histograms, applying data selection, and outputing histogram and flat tree ROOT files.
2. **Step 1**: Create your DSelector using the command 'MakeDSelector'
3. **Step 2**: Let's fill a histogram to see the FCAL shower quality factor
4. **Step 3**: Let's apply a chiSq selection
5. **Step 4**: Let's fill an AmpTools ready flat tree
