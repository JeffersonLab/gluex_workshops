# How to Fit With Amptools and Plot the Results Using Python

## :dart: Goals
- Learn how to write a simple `.cfg` file to perform mass-independent fits
- Use the `vecps_plotter` for a single bin fit result to gain intuition of the intensity model
- Aggregate fit results across multiple bins with AmpTools + Python
- Utilize Python to quickly plot fit results across $\omega\pi^0$ mass, and access other information.

## :clipboard: Prerequisites
- [I'll need to have a simple python venv and instructions how to use it. Maybe make a global one in the parent dir?]
- [List any prior knowledge, tools, or setup required for this session]
- [Include links to any resources or instructions for setup]

## :file_folder: Materials Provided
- [List of files, scripts, or datasets provided for this session. Large datasets should be located in `/work/halld/gluex_workshop_data/tutorial_2025` and referenced]
- [Links to any additional resources or documentation]
