PURPOSE:
The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize users with histogramming and cuts in JANA.  

Input REST Skim File:
~/workshop_data/session2b/dana_rest_omega.hddm

STARTING (REFERENCE) PLUGIN:
$WORKSHOP/session2b/omega_ref/

EXERCISES:
0a) In $HALLD_MY, create your own plugin from scratch, following the steps during the talk. 
0b) OR: Copy the reference plugin to your $HALLD_MY folder, so that you have your own copy to edit.  This will install over the original though. 
1) Histogram missing transverse momentum
   - Do this before the kinematic fit, and after the +/- 5 sigma kinematic fit confidence level cut
2) To look at the size of the rho background, histogram 2d invariant mass: 3pi vs pi+,pi-
   - Do this before the kinematic fit
   - Do this with the kinfit results: with a 0% kinfit confidence level cut, and a +/- 5 sigma cut (5.73303E-7)
3) For combo particles, hist comparison between generated & reconstructed kinematics (after the +/- 5 sigma kinfit cut)
   - Using both measured data and kinematic-fit data
