The goal of this session is to practice loading GlueX software and running jobs on the JLab CUE.
These scripts can be used as a starting point for further data analysis.

To configure the GlueX software, load the gluex_env_jlab.[c]sh script as in the following:

   source gluex_env_jlab.sh

To use your a diffent copy of sim-recon, change version_workshop.xml 
- To use one of the tagged "official" versions:
    <package name="sim-recon" version="1.11.1"\>
- To use one of your own personal copies (example):
    <package name="sim-recon" home="/work/halld2/home/sdobbs/my-sim-recon-dir"/>

To setup your batch job exercise:

mkdir -p /work/halld/home/$USER/
cp -R /group/halld/Software/workshops/physics_workshop_2016/session7b /work/halld/home/$USER/workshop_exercise
cd /work/halld/home/$USER/workshop_exercise

To setup the plugin for the exercise:

mkdir -p $HALLD_MY/plugins/omega_ref
cp -R /group/halld/Software/workshops/physics_workshop_2016/session2/omega_ref $HALLD_MY/plugins/omega_ref
cd $HALLD_MY/plugins/omega_ref
scons install

To submit analysis jobs to the batch queue:

1) Edit swif_gluex_analysis.py to set the configuration variables for your job

2) Run the script, e.g., "./swif_gluex_analysis.py" - this will create a SWIF workflow.
   You can then deal with the workflow using standard SWIF commnads, e.g.
      "swif run -workflow MY_WORKFLOW_NAME"
