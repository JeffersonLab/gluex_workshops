PURPOSE:
The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize users with using DSelector's in ROOT.  

Input ROOT TTree File:
~/workshop_data/session3/tree_omega_sim1_10000_0.root

STARTING (REFERENCE) DSELECTOR:
$WORKSHOP/session3a/DSelector_omega_ref.*

EXERCISES: 
0a) FOR ALL: Make sure to check for uniqueness before histogramming (don't histogram duplicates!)
0b) In ~/Scratch/, create your own DSelector from scratch, following the steps during the talk. 
0c) OR: Copy the reference DSelector files to ~/Scratch/, so that you have your own copy to edit. 
1) Histogram the kinematic fit confidence level. Cut it at +/- 5 sigma (5.73303E-7).
2) Histogram the omega invariant mass after the kinfit cut: with measured data, and then with kinfit data.
