\section{Preliminaries}

\ft{Defining terms}

event generation: specifying initial particles produced
  initial usually means point of interaction of beam and target particle
detector simulation: conveying particles through the detector
  tranport
  interaction with material
    production of secondaries
  decay
    production of decay products
smearing: introduction of detector resolution at the hit level
  separate step 

\section{Event Generation}

\ft{Programs}

particle gun: generate one-particle events
genr8: produce X particles in $\gamma p \rightarrow (p {\rm or} n) X$
bggen: produce events reflecting the total hadronic cross section for photoproduction in Hall D

\ft{particle gun overview}

\I useful for developing/testing event reconstruction in a simple context
\I option to HDGEANT, not a stand-alone program
\I can specify particle type, range of directions, range of momenta
\I see description of HDGEANT below

\subsection{genr8}

\ft{genr8 overview}

\I useful for calculating acceptance and resolution for signal events
\I generates the reaction $AB \to CD$ via exchange of virtual particle
  \I in our context: $\gamma p \rightarrow (p {\rm or} n) X$
  \I cross section assumed $\propto e^{-bt}$ where $t$ is momentum transfer squared, $b$ user-specified slope
  \I final-state particles can decay, one decay mode per particle???
  \I decay model???
\I configuration via text file and command line arguments
\I output in specialized format
\I output converted with genr8\_2\_hddm to HDDM format, z-spread added???

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%    genr8 input file usage: 
%
%            genr8 -M100 -Aoutput.ascii -n < reaction.input
%
% Example: gamma p -> omega Delta+          (All decays are isotropic)
%                      omega -> pi0 gamma
%                      Delta+ -> p pi0
%
%  hint: use "-n" flag to actually print the particle names in the
%        the output for viewing/debuging, but remember not to use "-n" 
%        for data that is used as input to HDFast.
%
%  modified June 21, 2001: ejb
%       include decays of pi0-->gamma gamma
