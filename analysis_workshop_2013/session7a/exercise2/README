This exercise is to simply convert the analysis TTree's to a format which is compatable with with AmpTools.  Paul wrote a generic converter $HALLD_HOME/src/programs/Utilities/tree_to_amptools which uses the analysis TTree to write the required kinematic information in a new TTree compatible with AmpTools.  

Analysis TTrees containing only combos surviving the BDT cut have been produced for larger evaluation sample of signal and background events and are stored at $GLUEX_DATA/session7a/.  From these samples we produce the input files to AmpTools for our "data" using tree_to_amptools.

Steps:

1) Execute the following script to produce the AmpTools imput 

./prepAmpToolsInput.sh
