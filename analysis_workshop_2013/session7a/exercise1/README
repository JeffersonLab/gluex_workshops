The goal of this excercise is to use the weights files generated in the BDT training process to select events for amplitude analysis.  The weights files written in the previous training step are used in the TMVA::Reader class to compute the BDT classifier value for each combo, which can then be cut on to give the desired purity/efficiency.

Steps:

1) First move to the directory used in the previous example from session 6b where you should already have links for 

selector_tree_n3pi.C
selector_tree_n3pi.h

if not remake them, then add a link to the macro for processing

ln -s $SESSIONS/session7a/exercise1/postTrain_n3pi.C

2) Then use a TSelector to process the analysis TTree and output a smaller analysis TTree containing only events which satisfy the user defined BDT cut with the following macro

root -l postTrain_n3pi.C
