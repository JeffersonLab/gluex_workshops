Analysis scripts developed as part of the Spring 2018 Workfest 

https://halldweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/GlueX_Analysis_Workfest_2018 

should be stored here for version control and sharing amongst participants during the workfest.  After the workfest final versions of the necessary scripts will likely be placed in the relevant locations of sim-recon for use in the data monitoring, etc.

The tasks for the workfest are broken into 2 teams:

R&D Team (team_rd) and Validation Team (team_validation)

Please create directories as necessary to organize your scripts for a given tasks.
